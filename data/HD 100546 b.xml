	<description>HD 100546 is a Herbig Ae/Be star. High contrast observations of the circumstellar disk reveal an emmision source at a distance of 68 astronomical units. The most likely explanation is a planet in the process of forming. If confirmed, HD100546 b would be a unique laboratory to study the formation process of a new planetary system, with one giant planet currently forming in the disk and a second planet possibly orbiting in the disk gap at a smaller separation.</description>

	<imagedescription>This artist's impression shows the formation of a gas giant planet in the ring of dust around the young star HD 100546. This system is also suspected to contain another large planet orbiting closer to the star. The newly-discovered object lies about 70 times further from its star than the Earth does from the Sun. This protoplanet is surrounded by a thick cloud of material so that, seen from this position, its star almost invisible and red in colour because of the scattering of light from the dust.
