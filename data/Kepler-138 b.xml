	<description>Kepler-138 b has been discovered by the Kepler spacecraft and was first announced in 2014. In June 2015, a team of astronomers has measured the mass and size of Kepler-138 b to find that it is in fact the smallest exoplanet yet. Kepler-138 b is a Mars-sized object orbiting a red dwarf star about 200 light years from our solar system. Current measurements are consistent with a variety of compositions, and favor compositions that are mostly rock. All three planets orbiting Kepler-138 are close to their star and are most likely are too hot to be habitable.</description>
