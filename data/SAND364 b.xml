	<description>The host star of SAND364 b is located in the old open star cluster Messier 67 (M67). There are few galactic clusters which are older and none of those are as close as M67. The survey was conducted by European astronomers. They found that massive planets around stars of open clusters are as frequent as those around field stars.</description>

	<imagedescription>This artist's impression shows one of the three newly discovered planets in the star cluster Messier 67. In this cluster the stars are all about the same age and composition as the Sun. This makes it a perfect laboratory to study how many planets form in such a crowded environment. Very few planets in clusters are known and this one has the additional distinction of orbiting a solar twin - a star that is almost identical to the Sun in all respects.
