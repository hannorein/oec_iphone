	<description>The star YBP1194 is one of the best solar twins identified so far. Its composition and age is very similar to that of our own Sun. It is located in the star cluster M67 and hosts a 0.34 Jupiter mass planet. The frequency of massive planets around stars of open clusters such as M67 turns out to be very similar to that of field stars.</description>

	<imagedescription>This wide-field image of the sky around the old open star cluster Messier 67 was created from images forming part of the Digitized Sky Survey 2. The cluster appears as a rich grouping of stars at the centre of the picture. Messier 67 contains stars that are all about the same age, and have the same chemical composition, as the Sun.
