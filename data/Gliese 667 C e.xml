	<description>Gliese 667 is a nearby triple star system in the constellation Scorpius, about 22 light years away. The star Gliese 667 C hosts at least six planets. Three of them, all Super-Earths, are located in the habitable zone. The habitable zone is so densely packed that any additional planet is likely to destabilize the system. This planet, Gliese 667 C e, is close the outer edge of the habitable zone.</description>

	<imagedescription>This artist's impression shows the view from the exoplanet Gliese 667 C d looking towards the planet's parent star (Gliese 667 C). In the background to the right the more distant stars in this triple system (Gliese 667 A and Gliese 667 B) are visible and to the left in the sky one of the other planets, the newly discovered Gliese 667 Ce, can be seen as a crescent. A record-breaking three planets in this system are super-Earths lying in the zone around the star where liquid water could exist, making them possible candidates for the presence of life. This is the first system found with a fully packed habitable zone.
